# Profile Matching

> In Development

This app was build using Vue JS and is basucaly a app that you can sign in and
create your profile. After that you can search for another users
(will be implemented) and check which topics the user have in common with
yours.

No live version yet, but will add one soon.

To run it in your machine you need to download the backend too. It was build
with django-rest-framework. [Backend page](https://github.com/diegommarino/profile_matching_django).
